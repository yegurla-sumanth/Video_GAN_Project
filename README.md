# Unconditional Video Generation using VideoGAN

Course Project done as part of Generative and Graphical Models for Machine Learning (AI60201) @ IIT Kharagpur

## Gist

* Trained a convolutional [VideoGAN](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~vondrick/tinyvideo/paper.pdf) model on UC11 dataset to generate new videos.
* The Video Generation is Unconditional i.e., the generated video takes noise vector as input rather than image, text etc.,
* Used Frechet Video Distance (FVD) as a metric to evaluate the performance of the Generator
* Please go through the Report for more details
